        From our initial interviews, one potential demographic was people with
        strict dietary restrictions.
      </p>
      <p class="pbody">
        Our interviews indicated that people with dietary restrictions often are
        left guessing at what is in their food when eating out due to the
        difficulty of accessing dietary information.
      </p>
      <p class="pbody">
        Additionally, the people we interviewed stated that there are many
        available solutions, but many are specific to one type of dietary
        restriction and often misses one core feature that then requires them to
        use multiple tools to track their food intake.
      </p>
      <p class="pbody">
        We thought this issue was very salient and a good balance between
        practicality and difficulty, so we decided to stick with it.
