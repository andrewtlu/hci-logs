        Having decided to target the demographic of individuals with dietary
        restrictions, we referred back to the initial research we did and
        interviewed additional individuals.

        Interestingly enough, within interviewees there was an interesting
        dichotemy of tech usage, as diabetics tended to be more reliant on
        technology than those with Celiac. Additionally, there seemed to be a
        disconnect between the effort people say they need to track food vs the
        actual effort.

        For example, Stefano said he could eat anything but also needed to
        anticipate and track carbs to insure proper insulin levels. He
        downplayed the impact on daily life but is also hyperdependent on his
        phone. He used more preventative measures but also said he could
        basically forget about his condition. Another interviewee stated that
        they needed to watch what they ate and avoid some restaurants completely
        while being able to eat out very freely. We thought this may have been
        due to a tendency to hide his condition/avoid discomfort in group
        settings.
